## Model policy — not a live model switch
```json
{
  "implementation": "balanced",
  "review": "balanced",
  "effort": "medium",
  "escalation": "Triage the failure; at most 2 repair attempts, then explicit review. No automatic spending authorization."
}
```

## Acceptance
- **R-WISKEY-VISITS-2400-1 / AT-WISKEY-VISITS-2400-1:** WisKey visit requests and guest templates are mapped onto Arx visitors / external access, or retired, per the owner decision.

## Deliverables
- Implementation and regression tests on an isolated branch
- Change record and known limits

## Guardrails
Read AGENTS.md and the linked master chapters. Inspect legacy code before replacement. No production configuration writes, physical commands, spending, or claims of passing unrun tests. Record commit, environment, commands and evidence.
