# BOARD-HYGIENE-2403 — Task board hygiene after v2.40.2

> Generated card. Edit management/tasks.json, then run this script with --write.

**Phase:** V1 | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** REVIEW

**Owner role:** engineering | **Hardware:** False

**Dependencies:** None

**Chapters:** 

**Screens:** N/A

## Model policy — not a live model switch
```json
{
  "implementation": "balanced",
  "review": "balanced",
  "effort": "medium",
  "escalation": "Triage the failure; at most 2 repair attempts, then explicit review. No automatic spending authorization."
}
```

## Acceptance
- **R-BOARD-HYGIENE-2403-1 / AT-BOARD-HYGIENE-2403-1:** Every BACKLOG and BLOCKED card at v2.40.2 is checked against git; shipped cards move only where the registry rules allow, with evidence; obsolete candidates are listed for the owner, never marked.

## Deliverables
- Implementation and regression tests on an isolated branch
- Change record and known limits

## Guardrails
Read AGENTS.md and the linked master chapters. Inspect legacy code before replacement. No production configuration writes, physical commands, spending, or claims of passing unrun tests. Record commit, environment, commands and evidence.
