## Model policy — not a live model switch
```json
{
  "implementation": "balanced",
  "review": "balanced",
  "effort": "medium",
  "escalation": "Triage the failure; at most 2 repair attempts, then explicit review. No automatic spending authorization."
}
```

## Acceptance
- **R-WISKEY-STATION-OPS-2390-1 / AT-WISKEY-STATION-OPS-2390-1:** Sync now (person / station / all), rescan, health refresh and clock refresh from Arx on a closed maintenance channel with permission, station scope and audit.

## Deliverables
- Implementation and regression tests on an isolated branch
- Change record and known limits

## Guardrails
Read AGENTS.md and the linked master chapters. Inspect legacy code before replacement. No production configuration writes, physical commands, spending, or claims of passing unrun tests. Record commit, environment, commands and evidence.
