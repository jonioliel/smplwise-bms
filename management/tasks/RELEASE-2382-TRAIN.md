## Acceptance
- **R-RELEASE-2382-TRAIN-1 / AT-RELEASE-2382-TRAIN-1:** Release 2.38.2 = 2.38.1 plus the merged train branches, gated on the runner, merged to main and tagged v2.38.2.

## Guardrails
Read AGENTS.md and the linked master chapters. Inspect legacy code before replacement. No production configuration writes, physical commands, spending, or claims of passing unrun tests. Record commit, environment, commands and evidence.
