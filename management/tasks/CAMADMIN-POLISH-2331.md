## Model policy — not a live model switch
```json
{
  "implementation": "balanced",
  "review": "balanced",
  "effort": "medium",
  "escalation": "Triage the failure; at most 2 repair attempts, then explicit review. No automatic spending authorization."
}
```

## Acceptance
- **R-CAMADMIN-POLISH-2331-1 / AT-CAMADMIN-POLISH-2331-1:** The privacy masks editor fits the window on a wide screen and the multi-camera batch list and progress rows are clearer.

## Deliverables
- Change record docs/changes/CAMADMIN-POLISH-2331.md

## Guardrails
Read AGENTS.md and the linked master chapters. Inspect legacy code before replacement. No production configuration writes, physical commands, spending, or claims of passing unrun tests. Record commit, environment, commands and evidence.
