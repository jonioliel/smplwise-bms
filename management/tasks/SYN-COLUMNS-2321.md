## Model policy — not a live model switch
```json
{
  "implementation": "balanced",
  "review": "balanced",
  "effort": "medium",
  "escalation": "Triage the failure; at most 2 repair attempts, then explicit review. No automatic spending authorization."
}
```

## Acceptance
- **R-SYN-COLUMNS-2321-1 / AT-SYN-COLUMNS-2321-1:** Synoptic map columns with no data source are hidden (a setting, on by default, with a quiet note) and a custom column choice exists.

## Deliverables
- Code and tests in git history of the merged branch

## Guardrails
Read AGENTS.md and the linked master chapters. Inspect legacy code before replacement. No production configuration writes, physical commands, spending, or claims of passing unrun tests. Record commit, environment, commands and evidence.
