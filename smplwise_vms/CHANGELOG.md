# Changelog — SMPLWISE VMS add-on

## 0.1.1 (pilot, in progress)
- Live video: go2rtc adapter (namespaced `smplwise_*` streams only), authorized WebSocket relay,
  WebRTC/MSE player with automatic fallback and a transport default in Settings.
- NVR snapshots (read-only) as tile posters, cached in /data.
- Settings API (media transport, session cap, wall profile, snapshot freshness) and the Settings →
  וידאו ומדיה tab (go2rtc status, stream sync, open sessions).
- Camera view, wall, kiosk and the map popover use real streams and snapshots when a backend answers.
- Options: `nvr_rtsp_port`, `go2rtc_api_username`, `go2rtc_api_password`.
- Fixes: request transactions start with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (no "database is locked" when two live
  sessions end together); a live session is always released, even if its audit row fails; httpx/httpcore
  logging is capped at WARNING so source URLs never reach the add-on log; the floor-map nav entry opens
  the first real floor instead of the fixture id.

## 0.1.0 (pilot, in progress)
- Ingress-only FastAPI backend with SQLite in /data and versioned migrations.
- Identity from Supervisor Ingress headers; explicit bootstrap of the first VMS administrator.
- Sites → buildings → floors; plan assets (PDF/PNG/JPG), derived plan versions with rotation/crop,
  draft → published, map anchors with revisions and tombstones; audit log.
- Read-only camera discovery from the NVR (channels, online state, track ids).
- Built web UI (Hebrew, RTL, boards-language) served from the add-on.
